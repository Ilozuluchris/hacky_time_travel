# Introduction
Welcome to Hacky time travel! This project is designed to introduce you to web scraping with python.
Together we are going to get note worthy events that happened
today, by scraping a website (web scraping), and go through them in chronologically order there by giving
us a "time travel" experience.

## Prerequisites
- Some python knowledge.
- Basic CSS (to be particular css selectors) knowledge.
- Python 3 installed, preferable python 3.8 but any version from 3.6+ should work
- A code editor.

## Setup
- Navigate to the root folder of the project.
- Install requirements in requirements.txt preferably in a virtual environment, personally I recommend [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
    - Using pipenv: `pipenv install -r requirements.txt --three`
-  Run `ptw` or `pytest-watch` on your terminal to verify setup, all tests should fail, which is a good thing. Keep this running, so we can watch the tests pass as we progress.

## What Next?
Once you are done with the setup, feel free to dive into the tasks.

## Some tips for tasks
- Pay attention to the function names mentioned in tasks, **do not change them** unless the tests would never pass
- If you use different variables from those listed in the tasks, ensure you stick to the new names you use in later steps. 
- Pay attention to strings(and the lack of strings) especially those that appear inside back ticks(``).
